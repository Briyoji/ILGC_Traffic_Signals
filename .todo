[ ] - 




[ ] - Future Goals -> AIM -> To make a robust transport system and not just an app integration. 
                        1. Implementation and integration with automated vehicles. 
                        2. Optimisation with other transport system solutions {eg. Sensing vehicles in lane.} i.e. When a vehicle crosses the midpoint of the stretch b/w two junctions, the junction ahead will be intimated about the vehicle's arrival.
